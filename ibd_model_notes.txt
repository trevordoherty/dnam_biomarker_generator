READING IN DATA

File: read_data.py
betas_ibd.csv was extracted from a file called rgSet.csv obtained from the IBD ML project folder on OneDrive.
The data was extracted using the the R script "extract_betas_for_clocks.R" which is stored at: C:\Users\User\Desktop\D Drive\ibd\epi_clock_analysis\r_scripts


PREPROCESSING
Some preprocessing of data was conducted initially to get the DNAm features and labels into a single file that could be passed to the pypi package as input.
